Update header copy:

The Blue Diamond Awards have celebrated the best in technology in the Greater Charlotte region for 20 years.

Join the celebration. <Link and Anchor to the “Nomination Categories”>

Remove “See winners” button
Add a section in between the header and nomination categories that congratulates the 2015 winners
Use logos for winners in one line - try to have header, section title and winner logo above the fold if possible 
Have finalists listed in text 
Having recognizable logos (Newell Rubbermaid, CMS, etc…) reinforces validity. 
Separate URLs with permalinks for nominees/winners/categories.
Confirm nomination category details:
Categories
Descriptions
Form fields
Can we adjust layout so you can see all categories in one screen?
Reduce size
Make 4x2 instead of 2x4?
Switch sponsorship and newsletter sign up
Sponsorship section:
Adjust formatting of logos to condense this section
Add news section with featured article, link to feed for all news articles
Can we consider a refined footer that contains:
Newsletter sign up
Twitter and Facebook icons
Contact form 
Forms:
I think these were O.K., unless the judges/awards committee saw changes.
Were users able to save and continue later?
Consider Google Forms for easy integration
Overall: 
Will want to update copy throughout site in next few weeks 
Will want to add press releases as published
