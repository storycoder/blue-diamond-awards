<!-- Nomination Forms -->


<!-- Please look these over. I don't like the size of the text boxes. But by choosing that option, I'm able to allow for specific validations that limit max # of characters. I also have concerns about how the forms are set in. I created a form for corpoeations/orgs and one for individual because it has an additional field for name of the person. -->
